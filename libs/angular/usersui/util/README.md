The **Angular UsersUI Util** library provides shared utilities, helper functions, and models used throughout the Users
UI module in the JDW platform. This includes reusable date utilities and strongly-typed user-related models to ensure
consistency and reduce duplication across the codebase.

## 🔧 Usage

This library is designed to be imported across multiple libraries and components to ensure centralized utility logic and
typings.

### Using a Utility Function

```ts
import { dateSortComparator } from '@jdw/angular-usersui-util';
```

### Using a Shared Model

```ts
import { User } from '@jdw/angular-shared-util';
```

## 📌 Notes

- This library contains utilities that are framework-agnostic and safe to use across both feature and data-access
  layers.
- All utility functions are unit tested and follow consistent naming conventions.
- Models are strongly typed and align with backend contract definitions where possible.
