# JDW Monorepo

## Running tasks
To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:
```
npx nx <target> <project> <...options>
```
You can also run multiple targets:
```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```
or add `-p` to filter specific projects
```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. [Learn more](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks).

## Explore the project graph
Run `npx nx graph` to show the graph of the workspace.
It will show tasks that you can run with Nx. [Learn more](https://nx.dev/core-features/explore-graph)
