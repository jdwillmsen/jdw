## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- Nx CLI (for running workspace commands)
- Cypress (included with the project)

### Development

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running E2E Tests

To run the end-to-end tests for UsersUI:

```bash
nx e2e usersui-e2e
```

This will trigger Cypress to execute the test suite against your UsersUI application.

---

## 📦 Deployment / CI

UsersUI E2E tests are executed as part of the CI/CD pipeline to ensure that functionality is verified before deployment. Ensure that the UsersUI application is available and accessible in your CI environment for the tests to execute properly.

## 📌 Notes

- The project uses [Nx](https://nx.dev/) for workspace management.
- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) is used for writing and running end-to-end tests.
- The folder structure is organized for ease of maintenance, with clear separation between tests, fixtures, and support files.
